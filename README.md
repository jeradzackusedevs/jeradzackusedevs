# 👨‍💻 Jerad Zackuse

**Backend Developer | Linux SysAdmin | Automation Engineer**

I build secure, fast, and reliable backend systems that *just work*.  
From Python scripts to FastAPI microservices to hardened Linux servers — I automate the boring stuff, scale the important stuff, and deploy clean every time.

### 🚀 What I Do:
- 🔧 **Python + Bash automation** — for tasks, workflows, scrapers, and system operations
- ⚡ **FastAPI backend development** — lightweight, async APIs built right
- 🔐 **Linux server setup & hardening** — security-first, production-ready systems
- 🔁 **CI/CD pipelines** — GitHub Actions, Docker, Ansible, zero-downtime deployments

### 🛠 Tech Stack:
`Python` `Bash` `FastAPI` `Docker`  
`GitHub Actions` `Ansible` `PostgreSQL`  
`Nginx` `Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)` `Systemd`
